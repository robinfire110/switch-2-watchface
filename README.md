Nintendo Switch 2 countdown watchface for Pebble Time/Pebble Time Round

# Rebble App Store Link
TBD

# Description
This watchface was made as part of the Rebble Hackathon #2. 
It provides a clean, Nintendo Switch 2 themed watchface that counts down to the release of the console. It was inspired by a [similar watchface](https://store-beta.rebble.io/app/58ab05230dfc3250450006ba) that was made for the release of the original Nintendo Switch 8 years ago.

If you wish to install this watchface, please do so through the Rebble App Store link above. 
Please let me know of any problems by sumbitting an issue.

The Pebble documentation is all over the place since they shut down, so feel free to use code from this repo to help you in your own projects. You're free to reference and use this code, but please don't take the whole project and upload it as your own.

Enjoy!
